# game
- settle on best way to pick moves
- validate initial_board


# web
- django? flask?
    - (if django, just an app? whole fake project? advantage: flask?)
- workflow:
    1. visit page, render empty board (handlebars?)
    2. click on a square
    3. square turns X
    4. Post game board to web
    5. New board comes back
    6. Re-render board (or end game)
    7. go to 2
